## Coding JetBear with Pygame

I coded a crappy javascript game a long time ago.  the [game](http://www.bocifious.com/jetbear.html) sucks but could be re-purposed into a 
python based game with some ease, since many of the sprites/graphics already exist 
(_I'm not a designer; luckily I was working with a buddy who did some pixel sprites_)

My idea is to create a background scrolling game where you control a bear to go up and down in order to catch salmon and avoid beehives.  
I have no experience with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) or creating games in Python so the more help I can get the better.  
I can also provide hosting for the finished game.
